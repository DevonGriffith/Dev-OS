# Dev-OS
An Operating System (OS) built from scratch with assembly and C. Tutorials and instructions are provided in each section, to explain the process. This OS was written on a Mac initially, so if you are also on a Mac, do the following:

[http://brew.sh/] (Install Homebrew)
brew install qemu nasm (Do NOT Use XCode's nasm, use usr/local/bin/nasm)
If you run into errors try calling: qemu-system-x86_64 binfile

This project was started using research from Nick Blundell.
