# OS
An Operating System (OS) built from scratch with assembly and C. Tutorials and instructions are provided in each section, to explain the process. This OS was written on a Mac initially, so if you are also on a Mac, do the following:

[http://brew.sh/] (Install Homebrew)
brew install qemu nasm (Do NOT Use XCode's nasm, use usr/local/bin/nasm)
If you run into errors try calling: qemu-system-x86_64 binfile

Follow along at your own pace, and don't be scared to try experimenting as you get more familiar with the code. It's easy to copy and paste, it's a lot harder to understand what you've built when you don't know what it is you're doing each step of the way.

This OS is being maintained and updated on Windows and Linux environments.
